# About Digital library MZK

In the Digital library MZK you can find monographs, periodicals, manuscripts, maps, recordings, archivalias, sheetmusic or graphics.

The basic division of documents is:

__public documents__ 
* these are works in the public domain. They are not subject to author’s or publisher’s rights. They are freely accessible
__private documents__ 
* these are copyright works, which are protected by author’s or publisher’s rights (the duration of a copyright spans the author's life plus 70 years and 50 years from publishing)
* you can read them via [the browser with copyright content](http://vknihovne.mzk.cz/en/digitalni-knihovna) (but you cannot download and print)

__Questions and comments:__ if you have any questions or comments, please let us know on [digitalniknihovna@mzk.cz](digitalniknihovna@mzk.cz).
